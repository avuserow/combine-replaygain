combine-replaygain - A Combined ReplayGain Scanner

ReplayGain is cool, but the majority of scanner programs are written for a
single file type. The only scanners I have found that support all common
filetypes are built-in to media players like Winamp.

This is a small project intended as a makeshift solution to this problem. It
detects which scanners you have installed, and uses ffmpeg to convert unknown
filetypes to one of these.

In addition, this project does _not_ modify your existing files. This is
intended for use by the Acoustics Music Player, which has the philosophy of not
modifying music files at all. The main scanner program will only report a list
of files.

file(1) is used for file type detection. Sometimes mp3 files are not identified
properly, which will result in them being transcoded (possibly to a mp3!) and
then scanned. This is just slower and slightly less accurate.

In the future, a wrapper script to write tags to the individual files may exist.
Patches welcome.

Scanners supported directly:
- mp3gain (MPEG Layer III audio)
- vorbisgain (ogg vorbis audio)

Scanners that exist but are NOT supported yet:
- aacgain (MPEG-4 audio), just needs to be implemented
- WaveGain (uncompressed WAVE audio), just needs to be implemented

Scanners for uncommon filetypes which are unlikely to be implemented:
- wvgain (WavPack files)
- musepack

Scanners that are unsuitable for use:
- metaflac (FLAC audio), CANNOT be implemented as-is, since it always writes to
  the file
- Winamp, foobar2000, QuuxPlayer, MediaMonkey, etc

TODO:
- parallel mode
- implement aacgain, wavegain
- better file type detection
- ignore common non-music files found in music directories (album art,
  directories, text files)
- wrapper script for writing tags
- better logging and error checking
